## Pulsar Admin UI

The admin UI is based on [vue-element-admin](https://panjiachen.github.io/vue-element-admin/#/dashboard).

### Build

#### Installation

```bash

# install app's dependencies
$ npm install


```

#### Usage

```bash

# start to serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production with minification
$ npm run dev

```

#### Development

You can start a pulsar standalone. The Pulsar Admin UI will automatically connect to pulsar standalone via `http://localhost:8080`. Now you try to go to `tenants` page and create `tenant`.
